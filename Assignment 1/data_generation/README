This directory contains some programs for making test data, some of
which can be used directly, some of which might need further work by you.


Python programs (courtesy of Alex):


generate_random_integers.py:

generates a list of user-specified length
of random integers within a user-specified range.




generate_random_strings.py:

generates a list of user-specified length of random strings with an
average length and variance determined by the user.

You can easily join ip the code in these two programs to produce
key-value pairs.



No effort has been made to remove duplicates.  See Alex's lesson on
STILE on Testing Your Program Using Python for code that you can
incorporate to remove duplicates, sort, or reverse sort your list(s).



C program (a different approach):

generate_key_value_pairs.c

generates a list of user specified length, user-specified range for
the keys, of pairs of a key value followed by the key-th word in the file
/usr/dict/words, e.g.:
                          456    agate
                         4561    clobber
                        10000    granary

No effort has been made to remove duplicates.  You can pipe the output
into the UNIX command 'sort' if you want sorted output.

Don't forget to compile the program before you try to run it!
