Problem comprehension and assumptions:

From a selection of multiple sources (aid facilities), find the quickest
(``shortest'') path to a single destination (accident site). The conditions for
an appropriate source are that it has:
	The shortest travel time /to/ the destination.
and
	Can supply one or more of requested items for aid.

The item(s) request can be fulfilled by multiple sources.
Travel time between nodes is directional and measured in hours and thus
there exist no negative cycles or weights.

Approach:
	For each source, use Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path from
	the source to the accident location. For N sources and the use of a min-heap
	in the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, this would be
	O(N|E + V|log|V|). Using a Fibonacci heap would improve this.
	Uppon reconsideration, 

Alternative approach:
	The Floyd-Warshall algorithm allows the graph to be processed to find
	the shortest path between all points. Thus, the shortest path from A to C
	can be computed as the shortest path from A to B and then from B to C.
Alternative approach:
	In order to solve this multiple source shortest path problem, a path tree 
	from one source to a destination could be constructed and
	at each source, this tree only needs to be altered to compute the shortest
	path. This would be more appropriate if there were multiple sources and
	destinations (e.g. choosing the location of a factory such that it was
	optimally positioned near many shipping ports around a map from a set
	of possible build sites)
